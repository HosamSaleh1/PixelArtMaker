# PixelArtMaker
 A one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design,
and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
